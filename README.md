# Design and Analysis of Experiments - DEs/UEM #

> Works developed in the courses of Design and Analysis of Experiment I and II taught by professors [Diogo Rossoni](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4427847A1) and [Vanderly Janeiro](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4799061H1) at DEs/UEM.

## Multiple Comparison Tests: Bonferroni, Duncan and Dunnet
Joint work with my great friend and data scientist [Victor Hugo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-hugo-nagahama/).

We described the theoretical aspects of three tests used to multiple comparisons and applied them to analyse a real data set.
The analysis were conducted in SAS and R softwares.

## Analysis of the paper: "Biosorption of Direct Red-31 and Direct Orange-26 dyes by rice husk: Application of factorial design analysis"
This paper aims to describe the analysis performed in [Safa and Bhatti (2011)](https://github.com/AndrMenezes/dae1617/raw/master/work2/paper.pdf).
The analysis were conducted in R software.
